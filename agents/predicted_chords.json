I chose the key of C major as it is a common and neutral key that works well with the given lyrics.\n\nThe intro uses a simple C - G - Am - F progression, which sets the tone for the rest of the song.\n\nThe verse follows the same chord progression, with the melody centered around the chords C, G, and Am.\n\nThe chorus shifts to a new progression, using the chords G, F, C, and D. This progression creates a sense of resolution and completeness, fitting for a chorus.\n\nNote: This is just one interpretation of the chord progression. There are many possible chord progressions that could fit the given lyrics, and the final choice may depend on the desired sound and style of the song."
